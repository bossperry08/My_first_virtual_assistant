# My_first_virtual_assistant
My first ever virtual assistant :)))
How to use my code:
- Install wheel, pypiwin32 (if you are using Windows), pyaudio, pyttsx3, SpeechRecognition, gTTS in Python (it's better to install them from the terminal)
- Just basically run those codelines :)))
- P.S: For that main.py file, you must input your name and status from the keyboard. I'm gonna update a new version where you can speak with the VA soon!!!
